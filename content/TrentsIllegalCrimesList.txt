<h2>Illegal Crimes</h2>
<h4>Not to be confused with legal crimes</h4>
<p>Listing my wrongdoings so I don't forget, because the law sure won't.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vatican:</strong> Breaking into Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana, stealing early copy of Ars Goetia, Et Al. Angelo still won't return my calls!</li>
<li><strong>Luxembourg:</strong> At least 3 bank-heists? At least, 3&nbsp;<em>they</em> know about. Main crew busted 2019; remember that Vincenzo didn't snitch (surprisingly!) but Stefen did.</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong:</strong> Money laundering, cockfighting, racketeering. Some false flag (as South Korean agent) for Triads -- should be fine.</li>
<li><strong>Cuba: </strong>Not quite sure. Very crazy night. Something about one of Diaz-Canel's daughters, the pretty one. DON'T go back.</li>
<li><strong>South Korea:</strong> <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #000000;">HONG KONG WAS NOT FINE: SK Gov found out about Triad work in HK. Gov offered me if I could boost DPRK missile tech. That went real south, now they're tying loose ends -- me. Crossed DMZ back into SK, laying low in Jeju-do. Keena's raising cash for documents.</span></li>
